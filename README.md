# Smart Banking: Automating Operations with AI

## Overview

This project aims to significantly enhance the operational efficiency of banking processes through the integration of advanced AI technologies. By automating routine tasks, predicting workloads, detecting anomalies, effectively managing liquidity risk, and ensuring regulatory compliance, we seek to streamline operations, improve customer service, and optimize resource allocation.

### Liquidity Risk Management (USP)

Liquidity risk, inherent in financial institutions, refers to the potential difficulty in meeting short-term financial obligations due to an inability to convert assets into cash without significant loss. Effective management of liquidity risk is crucial for maintaining operational stability and financial resilience.

## Problem Statements
